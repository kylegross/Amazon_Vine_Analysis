# Amazon Vine Analysis
## Overview of Analysis
The purpose of this analysis was to assess Amazon Vine reviews to determine whether or not trends exist in customer approval. The Amazon Vine data assessed concerns children's toys.

## Results
There were a total of 146 Vine reviews, and 4,274 non-Vine reviews. In terms of the Vine reviews, there were a total of 73 five-star reviews. For the non-Vine reviews, there were a total of 2,182 five-star reviews. By percentage, the five-star Vine reviews equated to 50% of the total Vine reviews, and the five-star non-Vine reviews equated to 51% of the total non-Vine reviews.

## Summary
I do not believe there is any positivity bias in the Vine reviews, as the outcome for both Vine and non-Vine five-star reviews equate to 50% and 51%, respectively. I would rather conclude that there is no bias seen between the two types of children's toy reviewers. To single out whether or not a positivity bias truly exists (or does not exist), I would conduct an additional analysis on five-star reviews for Vine and non-Vine reviewers based on the type of children's toy. This would slim down the review parameters by type, allowing for a more detailed perspective of reviews. In addition, it would be beneficial to view the reviews based on the "verified_purchase" column, wherein we would view the data only for those reviews that are verified. It can be assumed that the reviews that are not verified are from those who did not buy the product, while verified purchasers are those who actually bought and used the product.
